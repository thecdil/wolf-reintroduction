## The Project 

This multimodal project was created by Flori Tulli with the support of the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning.

On this website, you can explore this project's three components.

1. **"Wolf Reintroduction (1995-2023)"** - A collage of Idaho composed of diverse regional sources about wolf reintroduction
2. An **Essay** about the process behind making the collage
3. A collection of over 60 regional sources, which can be found in **Map**, **Timeline**, **Subjects**, and **Browse**

The goal of these components is to show the various dimensions surrounding the wolf controversy: a coalescence of regional viewpoints and events stemming from the initial release of wolves in 1995.
