Wolf…a word that carries a lot of weight, especially in the state of Idaho. How did it come to this? How do we navigate the current discourses surrounding wolves? And how do wolves, in turn, navigate the landscape shaped by our discourses? 

## The Project

“Wolf Reintroduction in Idaho: A Multimodal Retelling” was created by Flori Tulli for her MA graduate non-thesis in 2022/2023 with the support of CDIL. This multimodal project is comprised of the physical collage titled “Wolf Reintroduction: 1995-2023,” an essay with compilation videos showing the process behind this project, and a collection of over 60 referenced sources about the history of wolf reintroduction in Idaho. The goal of both the art piece and this website is to show viewers the various dimensions surrounding the wolf controversy: a coalescence of regional viewpoints and events stemming from the initial release of wolves in 1995.   

## The Creator

Flori Tulli is a University of Idaho graduate student in English with an emphasis in the Environmental Humanities. She has always been fascinated by ecotones, or places where human and nonhuman elements intersect and interact. Wolf reintroduction in the Pacific Northwest is an example of such process. Her investigation of this topic focuses on the interconnectivity of historical, sociological, philosophical and ecological discourses surrounding wolf presence in Idaho. Information accessibility is also the forefront of her concern. With these objectives in mind, she has created a multimodal project to catalyze conversation and investigation about wolf reintroduction.
