{:.display-4}

Flori Tulli has previously volunteered with the Pennsylvania Natural Lands Trust for 10 years, assisting with wildlife management efforts.

## About the Website

This digital scholarship project was created in Spring 2023 in collaboration with Julia Stone (Digital Scholarship Librarian) and Evan Peter Williamson (Digital Infrastructure Librarian) from the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) as a final component of Flori's MA research. 
The website was built using a customized [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) template with features to support a multimodal essay weaving the writing, videos, art, and source objects together.
Please see the [Acknowledgements]({{ '/acknowledgements.html' | relative_url }}) for additional support and collaborators on the project.
