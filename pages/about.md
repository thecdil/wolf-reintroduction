# About Flori 

Flori Tulli is a University of Idaho graduate student in English with an emphasis in the Environmental Humanities. She has always been fascinated by ecotones, or places where human and nonhuman elements intersect and interact. Wolf reintroduction in the Pacific Northwest is an example of such process. 

Her investigation of this topic focuses on the interconnectivity of historical, sociological, philosophical and ecological discourses surrounding wolf presence in Idaho. Information accessibility is also the forefront of her concern. With these objectives in mind, she has created a multimodal project to catalyze conversation and investigation about wolf reintroduction.
