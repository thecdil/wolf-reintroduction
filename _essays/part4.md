Instead of a gross-looking timeline, I could include the Ninemile wolves instead, or perhaps just the title and QR code to the website. Maybe I could even include a helicopter-- schematization of the three modes of transportation that brought wolves from Canada to Idaho (helicopter, airplane and truck)--with my initial idea of detective lines connecting it to the release sites. There were so many better options than the timeline--visually speaking--either way, something had to be done, and it wasn't going to be easy. Trying to peal or cut it off proved fruitless, but thankfully the wolves crossing into Montana came off without much fuss. After showing the piece to directed study professor again--which he met with the familiar confused reaction toward the timeline--he suggested I should sand it off and paint a matte background color. My sister suggested I collage more on top and make a background scene. Ultimately, I decided on the sand and paint approach.  

After an hour or so of playing heavy metal and aggressively sanding (no video taken of this effort, unfortunately...), I exorcised the timeline from the piece. I found that a deep green covered base well. In retrospect, painting the base first would have made my life a lot easier, but I'll chalk that up to a learning curve. Once the paint dried, I added the title on cardboard and the helicopter, nailing down detective lines to connect it to the release sites. Once the website was created, CDIL and I designed a QR code--a wolf paw print--to be included on the artist's statement, connecting the physical collage to a digital space.  

You may be thinking, "Wow, this process was probably a lot harder than writing a paper.... Was it worth it?" 

Yes. Yes it was. I would go as far to say that this process was as complex and messy as wolf reintroduction itself, and maybe that's the point. This controversy has no easy answers, and it needs a lot of work, collaboration and creativity to solve. Sometimes the right way--at least, the way my passion led me--isn't the easy way. But it's worth it, the journey of growth--the journey of creation--the journey of experimentation.
