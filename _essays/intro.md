Wolf... a word that carries a lot of weight, especially in the state of Idaho. Opinions range from a supportive yearning for wilderness to a fervent desire to secure safe, usable land. While both proponents and opponents of wolves hold valid concerns about reintroduction, their conflicting discourses have turned the wolf into a controversial, polarizing figure. How did it come to this? How do we navigate the current discourses surrounding wolves? And how do wolves, in turn, navigate the landscape shaped by our discourses? My hope is that this project can act as a catalyst for conversation, one that allows viewers to see the various dimensions surrounding the topic of wolf reintroduction in Idaho.  

So why create a multimodal project? One key emphasis within the Environmental Humanities is the need for interdisciplinary, collaborative information channels, particularly to educate people about environmental issues. Throughout my experiences as a student, teacher, tutor and archivist, accessibility has been another central concern for successful communication. With these objectives in mind, I wanted to create a project that people will see outside of an academic sphere, stimulating fresh conversations and further investigations into understanding wolf reintroduction rather than pushing readers and viewers more deeply into their current points of view.   

It is for this reason that I turn to visual arts, not just for their aesthetic value but also their accessibility. Art can combine different modes of information in an interdisciplinary and engaging way. In his book Deep Affinities: Art and Science, Philip Palmedo explores the long-standing history (Paleolithic to modern day) of human art and science, two endeavors that have helped us to both understand and appreciate our world. Similar to science, art involves  translation, converting the perceived world into symbolic form: "schematization," the reduction of a figure to its essential traits. This concept of "essential traits" brings art close to the nature of science (Palmedo 16-18). By schematizing the abstract historical, sociological and ecological dimensions of wolf reintroduction, I aim to make it more understandable for audiences. Creating an art piece and website can help make a complex topic more accessible.
