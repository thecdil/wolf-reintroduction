Finally, I began to illustrate the wolves based on their descriptions. I was returning to my comfort zone--illustration--which made this part of the process the most meditative. As I drew them and mapped their locations on the collage, I imagined the wolves' journeys and their relationships with each other. This imagination helped me to design them, their release sites (schematized by cages), and their navigation through the landscape (pawprints from the release sites). When I finished drawing and cutting them out, I decided to add them onto thin pieces of cardboard to make them pop out, so that way they would still be part of the collage but not lost in it.  

After gluing them down and adding a few more details, I stepped back once again and felt relieved. Idaho looked good. The wolves looked great! But as my eyes traveled to Montana, my heart sank again. As I looked at the timeline, I saw how small the font is, how much information is trying to dominate the piece and how messy its outline looked (I'm pretty sure my hands were against this part of the piece from the get-go). What's more, the wolves made the timeline obsolete: ultimately, I was telling the story of the first wolves reintroduced, while the remaining history was irrelevant to that story. Coming back to that crossroad of stay or go, I found my answer: it had to go.
