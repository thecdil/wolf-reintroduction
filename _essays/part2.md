From here, I breathed a sigh of relief and went back to finding sources. At the same time, I began meeting with CDIL about formatting the website and how to collect and display sources that were primarily online. In order to give them materials to work with and to finish my collage, I had to wrap up my research. Honestly, I could have collected sources forever—falling down rabbit holes of different viewpoints. I had to stop myself at 70+ sources. 

After finalizing the citation list, I started to pick a few key pieces of writing and images from each region: Native American crests and mission statements, IDFG's regional descriptions, rancher and hunter perspectives, Sawtooth Pack research, Wood River Wolf Project statements, reintroduction articles around Yellowstone, bounty hunting posters, etc. Furthermore, I collected extra copies of outdoor magazines from the College of Natural Resources (CNR) for images of rangeland. At long last, I could start gluing down focal points!  

Actually placing items down was a bit jarring—trying to balance instinctual design with nuance and location accuracy—and I would later learn that haste sometimes has consequences. But initially, creating the middle layer went well! It all started to feel like it was coming together, though the more I glued down, the busier it became on top of a background already comprised of words. After consulting my artist sister, she suggested that the literature would need borders to make the texts stand out and pop. I agreed—meanwhile, Montana stood empty. At this point, I wasn't aiming to collect any more sources about Montana's wolf policy, but I had stumbled across the IDFG's timeline of wolf reintroduction in Wyoming, Montana, and Central Idaho.  

"Why not include the timeline to lead viewers to the current state of Idaho?" I thought, "Maybe I could even have detective-style strings leading from points on the timeline to areas on the map, where wolves were first released!" In theory, this sounded fantastic! I spent a lot of time cutting down the timeline--much of it legal back and forth between groups--to essential events, which still came out rather long. Determined--maybe even feverish--I began gluing down this summarized history, as you can see in the video.  

Now, dear reader, if you doubt my design choice at this point, or feel like the piece gets too busy--you are 100% correct! Remember when I said that haste could have consequences? Well, it did here...after stepping back, getting some sleep, and coming back to the piece the next day, I saw that it would info-whelm viewers. As Heather Houser explains in _Infowhelm: Environmental Art and Literature in the Age of Data_, infowhelming--providing too much information that overwhelms viewers―is the direct opposite of what ecological art should do. Ecological art should capture the essence of complex issues, conveying them in accessible ways. When I shared the timeline design with other people, their reactions said it all: furrowed brows, pursed lips, and general confusion.  

"Oh well," I thought and carried on outlining. My frustration made me outline details too heavily--particularly the timeline. Stepping back again, I felt really disappointed in the end result--everything looked too busy, too heavy, too messy. It wouldn't be too far to say that I felt disgusted at this point, thinking that the piece was a doomed failure, as I'm sure many artists feel when they get stuck. So as not to repeat my last hasty mistake, I left it alone and returned the next day with a fresh pair of eyes.  

Upon second inspection, I decided that it wasn't that bad, but definitely not what I was going for. Here, I came to another crossroad: keep the timeline, or ditch it? "I'll think about it," I decided, "but what to do about the wolves?" This was another element that confounded me, because I wasn't sure which wolves to include and when, how to schematize them, or how to design them. I was this close to printing out silhouettes, when my sister shamed me for even considering not drawing some element of the piece. While I was impatient to finalize it, I knew she was right. But what to draw? 

That's when I discovered a gold nugget of information within the University of Idaho's archives. As I processed the College of Natural Resources Special Collection, I came across two primary sources: a 2003 _SNAG_ article about wolves in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, and a 1995 _Frankly Speaking_ article, "Wolves Finding Their Niche in the River of No Return Wilderness."

The second source was about the first wolves release in Idaho, including their names, physical descriptions and locations! I felt like whatever divine mechanism running the universe smiled upon me that day--I finally had my designs! Furthermore, I had stories, such as a gray female named B-13, who was shot 10 days after release when she was found feeding on a calf carcass, or MoonStar Shadow's pairing with Lebrai and their journey to the Idaho-Montana Border west of Lost Trails Pass--among others (Brannon 1--2).
