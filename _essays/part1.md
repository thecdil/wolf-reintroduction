Creating an art piece and website was definitely taking the road less traveled by—and gratefully one supported by my advisors and mentors. Throughout this process, there were ups and downs, twists and turns, disorientation, and eventual clarity. Initially, I wanted to make another sculpture—this time using paper mache—of a wolf covered in sentences of the Idaho Senate Bill 1211—a simple yet stark figure that would address the influence of the legislation upon wolf presence.  

However, the more I thought about it, the less sense it made in isolation. While wolves travel off alone, they are primarily pack animals; furthermore, the Senate Bill is only one source surrounding the issue. The easy answer: make more wolves made of more sources, probably 5-6, like an average pack size. The ways in which individual pack members interacted would be telling of how different stances—indigenous, environmental, hunter, rancher, legislation, etc.—interact with each other, a visual representation of discourse and relationships. And the more I thought of the pack, the more I wondered about their placement and representation—what if the base of the sculpture was a map: Idaho, and perhaps Montana and Wyoming? That way, the literature of their forms would coincide with the locations on which they stood, putting their presence in relation to sociological environments. I even considered their paw placements having significance, but that would be determined by the sources I found. The piece I envisioned was substantial: a 2'x4' base. I also wanted to create a website with Center for Digital Learning and Inquiry (CDIL), which would accompany the sculpture as a database, where viewers could interact with the map and view sources.

With growing confidence, I began sketching this concept and researching which materials and techniques to use. But when I finally proposed the idea to my directed study professor, he gave me some constructive criticism: Would audiences be able to read literature on the wolves? How could 5-6 wolves encompass the nuances of each region? And perhaps most importantly, where could I keep this sculpture until the Ecological Art Gallery in next fall? COULD we fit it at the Gallery as a 2'x4' base? Wouldn't it be more accessible as a wall mount? 

To my dismay, the more I considered what he said, the more my initial vision began to crumble before my very eyes. I further consulted with my graduation project advisor about this change, who supported whichever design I would choose and encouraged me to consult more theory for defining my goals. Adding to some urgency, it was now the end of January, with the final deadline three months away.  

In retrospect, I believe that straddling between the expectations of a graduate student in English and ecological artist made encompassing both accuracy and instinctual vision much harder. As a writer, I want to create a nuanced, well-researched discourse—as an artist, I prefer creating simpler schematizations of figures, capturing their raw essence. To use both modes, I would need to pick up the pieces of my preliminary idea, assemble it into something new, and get out of my comfort zone(s).

I could have stubbornly stuck with my initial vision, but that would go against the collaborative and accessible nature of ecological art. In this instance, simplicity would not encompass the nuance I wanted. At the beginning of February, I spent to reworking the design, deciding that the wolf figures could be more hieroglyphic. For a time, I stuck with the idea of sculpting and integrating wolves onto the map, similar to a mosaic, and their designs off of real "outlaw" wolves. However, the more I thought of the literary elements, the more and more paper appealed to me as the ideal medium—ultimately, I decided on collaging.  

After buying a 2'x4' hardboard, I printed out maps of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming and I began sketching national parks, reservations, and city hubs on them—areas where literature would be very specific. Washington and Oregon followed soon after, having their own wolf discourses. I measured out these maps onto the hardboard, where I faced another dilemma: How much literature would I be encompassing? How many regions and visuals? How many wolves, and which ones? What time period would all elements be in? Would I have enough time to create an accompanying website? My heart sank as I watched the end of February drawing nearer, without my vision becoming any clearer.   

Stepping back, I had a realistic conversation with myself and decided that each state could potentially be its own piece—if I was making a concentration or mural. With one semester to nurture and grow a project, I would need to go back to “simplicity,” which led me to settle my research and efforts on Idaho. I decided to build off of my initial research into Idaho Senate Bill 1211 and add more discourse to the landscape—expressing the abstraction and disruption views can have on spaces. Adding to this conviction, I have had more experience living in Idaho than other states in the Pacific Northwest, as well as speaking with researchers and locals here. I found myself leaning toward quality over quantity.  

This decision helped immensely as I neared the end of February. Not only was I able to focus my research, but I was also able to provide CDIL with a more concrete outline of the website—primarily the interactive map.

From here, I compiled sources for each of Idaho's seven regions—regions based on the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG)'s hunting regions (Panhandle, Clearwater, Southwest, Magic Valley, Southeast, Upper Snake, Salmon), because those are what determine hunting and trapping seasons, number of tags, and other interactions with wildlife presence.  

After redrawing the base and mapping out regions and locations (for both Idaho and Montana, just in case I would integrate Montana sources), I decided to use the Senate Bill 1211 as the base of Idaho, since the policy effects the entire state. I wanted the words to literally shape the landscape, so I cut each sentence and glued them down in a spiral pattern, working from the top of the state down and into the middle.

As I did this, I had an additional copy of the bill for reference, highlighting each line that I glued down to make sure nothing got mixed up. After a very lengthy process, the final challenge was fitting the last page of the bill—I ended up using the passage bellow as Idaho's border, because it contained the most potent and relevant information to wolf management: 

> *Livestock and domestic animal owners may take all nonlethal steps they deem necessary to protect their property. …Wolves  may be disposed of by any federal agency, state agency, private contractor, political subdivision of the state of Idaho, or agency of another state when the population has exceeded the recovery goals of the Idaho wolf conservation and management plan in an effort to maintain a balance of all wildlife populations.*
> 
> -- 2021 Legislation: Senate Bill 1211
{:.blockquote}

This passage became a defining border, a line which, if crossed, determines a wolf's fate. After some experimentation with printing on yellow paper, I cut out and glued those colored sentences around the border.
